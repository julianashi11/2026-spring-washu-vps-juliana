	In the age of AI, I really enjoyed the perspective that Matt Webb brings to computers: cyborgs and rooms. Prior to reading the blog, I honestly thought of AI as a flat surface, but I didn’t realize the nuances in how it can affect both individuals and the environments we’re in. When I thought about how technology affects me personally, I thought about the AirPods I wear every day. I have never seen this technology in this light, but now I can see how these types of technologies are slowly turning us into “natural-born cyborgs.” In other words, they are turning the person into a computer, which is scary to think about since the future of AI is so unpredictable at this point in time.

    Even though both paths have the potential to be upgraded with AI, Webb is personally more excited about upgrading rooms. I have to agree with Webb on this because instead of upgrading the actual person, we could upgrade the atmosphere around them. Enhancing the environment where a person physically acts is just as crucial as enhancing human features within ourselves. Moreover, I believe that room upgrading imposes less cognitive strain on our brains because instead of technology doing the thinking or enhancing for us directly, it’s our surroundings that are being advanced, which we can then adjust and adapt to.

    Overall, I really appreciated the viewpoint that Webb brought, especially in the way he poses the important question: “While everyone else is building glasses, AR, and AI-enabled cyborg prosthetics that hang around your neck, what should we build in real life for the rooms where we live and work? What are the core enabling technologies?”
