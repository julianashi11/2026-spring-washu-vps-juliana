	The first line, “AI is gaslighting you,” immediately stood out to me. My mind began thinking about different interpretations, and I was instantly intrigued to read more about that sentence. Speaking from experience, I know that I have been fooled countless times by realistic AI-generated photos and videos, so this phrase was one that heavily related to. Ullendorff argues that AI lacks the expression that humans are capable of possessing in the art they create. As a result, Ullendorff develops a new Turing test with three simple criteria: <i>“From someone, for someone, in a particular context”</i>. What I thought was interesting with this rubric was how much I agreed with it. I have noticed that when I ask AI to write emails, the tone and feeling of its words are very generic, which defeats the personalized touches that emails are supposed to possess. What I have realized is that AI has taken out the people’s personality from the work they produce. So, with this new rubric, I completely agree that it should be clear where the work is coming from, who it will be for, and the particular context it is in. I know that AI can do this, but humans have a different sense of the connections and interactions that we make daily. In addition, Ullendorff also speaks on the increasing development of AI: “As the AI gets exponentially better at pretending to be us, that only moves the expressive goalpost, will we rise to the challenge of actually being us, but more?” I think this question is important to raise, because the argument is pretty split. Some will argue that we should eliminate AI, while others urge individuals to take full advantage of AI. As our world continues to develop, I am interested in seeing how the development of AI overall either deteriorates or benefits society.
