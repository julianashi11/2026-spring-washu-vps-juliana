        After reading this article, the impact that restaurant websites can have is much more profound than I had expected. My impression certainly changed in that there are a lot more meticulous details that go into making a good website for a restaurant. Compared to standard front-end practices for businesses/firms, the design for a restaurant is a lot more buried in nostalgic feelings, aesthetic vibes, and originality. More so, the “personality” of the restaurant should be conveyed through the design choices on the website. Toph Tucker mentions that Astro Restaurant's website didn’t need photographs of the restaurant to give them a good sense of what the restaurant would be like prior to going. In addition, having the website be constantly updated was crucial, such as creating seasonal menus, daily/weekly specials, and logistical updates. On the otherhand, a well-designed website is not the end-all, be-all. Simplicity can actually work in a restaurant's favor if matched with its aesthetic well. For example, Toph mentions a small town diner that only had a Facebook page with the description, “We’re still here.” Because that statement aligns with the vibe of the restaurant, it works in their favor when making an impression on its customers. It gives that “we’ve been here for a while” vibe but also one that offers a welcoming aura. In the end, what makes a good restaurant website varies in terms of aesthetic, technicality, simplicity, and the overall atmosphere. When it comes down to it, I believe the most important aspect is emphasizing the atmosphere so that the customer can easily align the website with the restaurant.
